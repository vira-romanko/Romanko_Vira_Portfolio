## Deployment

You can visit my site at https://viraromanko.herokuapp.com/

## Heroku Breakpoint
For some reason Heroku crashes on my lightbox functionality. So I just commented out the code that is responsible for it (main.js). It was not working perfectyly in my localhost - but it was working.... I still left the code so you can see that it is there.


## PHP Contact Form
For testing PHP contact form just use php folder.
In terminal go ``docker-compose up``
